/*
 *  the receiver class is using ServerSocket class, this may seem contrary to how packets actually are transferred
 *  mainly from server to client, but here my client(sender) sends and server reads, as we use client 
 *  side for user interaction in most of our programs. 
 *  
 *  Since the problem statement says peer-to-peer and focuses more on the go-back-n implementation, 
 *  this shouldn't be a problem(ideally).
 *  However, the sides can be switched based on personal preference.
