Instructions to run both the codes ie SelectiveRepeat and GoBackN  : 
Receiver.java runs first in one terminal
Sender.java runs next in a different terminal 

The codes are written in eclipse IDE, so in that case Receiver.java runs on one console instance and Sender.java on the second instance

Go Back N :

The code here for Go Back N implementation is based on the logic explained in the youtube video tutorial -

Selective Repeat is a further modification of the same code above.
